**Entity FJKS-MRFL-5914** is a variant of Nazi SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein from Universe V-949. Like other Fegelein variants, he enlisted in the Reichswehr cavalry in 1925, joined the SS on April 10, 1933, led the SS Totenkopf Reiterstandarte, and conducted the Pripyat Marshes massacres in 1941. Heinrich Himmler later assigned him as Hitler's liaison and SS delegate. Fegelein was present during the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler.

In the war's last phase, Himmler—who understood multiverse theory—taught Fegelein to prank Hitler using reality-distorting tactics. On April 30, 1945[^1], they deceived Hitler into shooting himself—by instructing him to summon his "persona" to change the war's course. Both vanished from V-949 shortly thereafter.

[^1]: 99.56.83.6.9.3598.69241350 in Loki-Archanfel notation.

Once escaped from V-949, Fegelein joined the League of Interdimensional Disruptors through Himmler's longstanding affiliations.

Following his escape from Universe V-949, Fegelein joined the League of Interdimensional Disruptors, facilitated by Himmler’s longstanding ties to the group. He succeeded in the Prankster Gangster's challenge[^2] on 198.8.31.3.6.8448.23546778, officially joining the ranks of the LID. Over time, he built trust with the league's high-ranking members.

[^2]: The Prankster Gangster's challenge is a rite of passage for LID recruits, requiring them to prank one million lifeforms within a universe in under 1,000 cycles. Fegelein achieved this by creating one million circular potholes beneath the victims' feet in just 989.78 cycles.

Fegelein, among the LID's most dependable members, has built his reputation on several notable semi-malicious reality-altering incidents classified between 2-Hancock and 3-Meteora categories. His antics cover a broad spectrum, including minor gags like manifesting banana peels to cause slips, to extreme gravitational manipulation resulting in a 2-Utonium physical break event in Paris of one universe, where roughly 85% of the population was lifted from the ground to outer space.

Though details remain vague, the Ministry asserts that the core reason behind Fegelein's "antics" is schadenfreude—he finds joy in provoking irritation and distress among those he targets.
