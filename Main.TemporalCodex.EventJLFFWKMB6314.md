**Event JLFF-WKMB-6314** is a level 6-Kazuraba hyper-physical large-scale apocalyptic event, generally manifesting as the destruction of a planet. Specifically, it involves the planet K-905778—referred to as "Earth" within Universe F-71563—ending its existence by emitting a glowing white light, leading to total devastation. This catastrophic event is tentatively hypothesised—and somewhat confirmed—to be a rebellious act by the dominant species, *Homo sapiens*, against one of the Ministry of Multiverse's ancient foes, Gog and Magog.

Coherent textual information about JLFF-WKMB-6314 is extremely limited. Nonetheless, Ministry operatives active in Universe F-71563 have gathered written accounts in the Standard script[^1], as well as pre-event visual records. A limited number of post-event materials have also been secured, enhancing the understanding of the incident.

Using these gathered materials, the Ministry has carried out a partial historical reconstruction of the critical events occurring before, during, and after JLFF-WKMB-6314. It is important to note that the collected data may contain errors or speculative assumptions; hence, readers should approach it carefully.

## Background

In the period preceding JLFF-WKMB-6314, Universe F-71563's planet K-905778, also called Earth, was the base of Splatorium-Dreifarb Inc., a multinational conglomerate and the largest corporation ever in this universe. This company was formed through the consolidation of several conglomerates, one of which was VortexOmegaCalibur Services, based in Belgium and historically linked to the Dutch East India Company, with one board member descending from a key figure of that company.

Known for its dominance, Splatorium-Dreifarb was the main producer of thousands of consumer goods and vital services across much of ████, ███████, and broad areas of ██████. The company held control over approximately 30 to 40 percent of the global economy, with vital industries such as energy completely reliant on its support.

Splatorium-Dreifarb was also infamous for a long history of human rights violations, unethical behavior, unauthorised experiments on living creatures, and aggressive promotion of superconsumerism. Among these was the notorious Mary Ocksberg case, where the company \[redacted], led to Ocksberg's unfortunate \[redacted]. In spite of these controversies, the United Nations lacked the capability to restrain Splatorium-Dreifarb's operations. The real authority was held by the Globo—previously the UN Economic Advisory Commission—a body controlled by a consortium of conglomerates led by Splatorium-Dreifarb, which exercised control over the world's nations.

Due to its expansive power, Splatorium-Dreifarb "secured" United Nations approval to establish its own paramilitary force. By 20██[^2], the paramilitary arm of Splatorium-Dreifarb had surpassed the military might of the most powerful superpower on F-71563's Earth. It covertly possessed advanced weaponry including ████ ██████, █████████ █████████ ███████ ████████, and ██ ████████ ████████ ████████ ███ █████████████ ███████████ ██████—many clearly breaching the United Nations' Kasukabe Treaty on Hyper-Advanced Arms. Among these was the Absolute Checkmate, deployed on the Dark Peninsula[^3], which triggered a mysterious and colourful explosion that erased the region from the map, effectively crushing the Brotherhood of Spartacus—a formidable guerrilla force that had waged war against the Globo for ten years.

Following their victory against the Brotherhood of Spartacus, half the continents lay devastated by warheads and weaponry, deemed incapable of sustaining proper civilian life over the long term. Nonetheless, to commemorate the victory, Splatorium-Dreifarb and the Globo organised an annual event known as Megafest. The upper class promoted Megafest as "the grandest celebration of mankind's triumph over unyielding terror and destruction, and the preservation of human legacy"—yet it was mainly a huge trade show for companies to advertise their products amid widespread consumer fatigue.

The festival's centrepiece was often a reenactment of the War on Globo—a decade-long war between the Globo and the Brotherhood of Spartacus. The reenactment involved two armies, staffed by convicts and criminals from worldwide, along with tanks and cutting-edge weaponry.

## History

In the final days before JLFF-WKMB-6314, amid the ██th Megafest, the Ministry's longtime enemies Gog and Magog, accompanied by leaders atop the dark-energy eldritch entity known as the "Emir of Malice" with its distinctive ten heads, gathered a vast force of monstrous creatures from numerous dark worlds and their subjugated territories. This army converged on Earth, positioned about two-thirds within its exosphere.

Their arrival triggered mass panic among native *Homo sapiens*, leading governments of all Earth's post-war nations to declare a state of emergency. Splatorium-Dreifarb promptly halted Megafest and sent out their paramilitary forces to push back the initial invasion by Gog and Magog. Intriguingly, mere hours before these events, internal turmoil within Splatorium-Dreifarb's leadership occurred. Although the details remain unclear, leadership soon shifted to Iyana Romojovitch, a businesswoman known for her concern for the impoverished over wealthy clients.

Despite their best efforts, Splatorium-Dreifarb could not stop the invasion led by Samael the Destroyer, Gog and Magog's most trusted general. Samael's legions resisted all carefully crafted human strategies. Within a short period, Earth experienced a Class T6-X-Absheron physical collateral corruption, devastating over 60% of its surface, including heavily populated cities such as New York and Hong Kong.

In the final seconds before JLFF-WKMB-6314, humanity's last survivors, led by the Skibidi Rescue Service (a Splatorium-Dreifarb subsidiary), created a superweapon capable of obliterating everything within █,███ kilometers. Importantly, the weapon was programmed to cause the death of its users—a preplanned feature. It was believed to be an upgraded and more potent version of the Absolute Checkmate. Analysis shows a 50–70% similarity between the destruction of the Dark Peninsula and JLFF-WKMB-6314, though full comprehension is lacking.

It is believed that this weapon was designed to wipe out both Earth and Gog and Magog, with humanity opting for self-sacrifice rather than surrender, acknowledging that if humans fell, so would their adversaries.

Upon activation, after five seconds, a brilliant white light engulfed Earth, quickly overcoming Gog and Magog's forces. Ministry drones recorded temperatures exceeding 13,000 degrees Celsius from the light. For ten seconds, horrifying screams and other eerie sounds filled the atmosphere. Then, the light gradually faded, leaving behind a glowing nebula within an asteroid field. Consequently, Earth (K-905778) was completely obliterated, definitively ending Gog and Magog's threat, and ensuring eternal freedom for other intelligent lifeforms.

The drones successfully withdrew to the Ministry's Base Delta Upsilon 71 but suffered extensive damage from the effects of the white light. The only transmission intercepted from Earth just before its destruction was recorded by the drones and later reconstructed using extensive quantum decryption techniques.

The source was a common Earth handheld radio device—known as a cell phone—whose graphical user interface remained corrupted. Its graphical user interface remained corrupted intentionally by the Ministry's scavengers to retain authenticity. The transmission contained bold white text stating:

!["EARTH LIVES! WE LIVE! GO TO HELL, GOG AND MAGOG! AND TAKE YOUR FRIENDS WITH YOU!"](https://files.catbox.moe/208xgu.png)

## Aftermath

As of now, no intelligent life forms have been spotted near the nebula found at the coordinates where Earth—celestial body K-905778—once existed.
